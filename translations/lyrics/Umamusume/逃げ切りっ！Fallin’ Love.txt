[Falko] Love knows not of "working hard"
Cuteness goes UpUp↑↑
I'm gonna show off now  Appeal all day!
A strategy? No, oh no!
[Suzuka] A starting dash is my groundwork  Leave them all behind!
Here I go  Check my way!
A smile on my face  To put a smile on yours

[Bourbon] "Super fast and super true"  It's just the way I roll
[Maru] Every time [Ines] That I look [Suzuka] In your eyes
[All] I wanna see myself in there!  That's what I want

Running away! (Running away!)
Breaking away! (Breaking away!)
[Falko] DARLING  I WANT YOU!!
[Bourbon] Love does not favor number two
[All] I'll overwhelm them with my lead

Running away! (Running away!)
Breaking away! (Breaking away!)
[Suzuka] BABY  I LOVE YOU
[All] I'm taking my next steps  Closer to you
I wish you could see just how I feel  My heart  Fallin' Love

[Maru] Being in love feels like my fate
The feelings come KnockKnock!!
Hoping to become your  Heroine all day!
A winning chance? For real, for real!
[Ines] Restraining or agitating  Something isn't right~
Wanna  Be My Self！
I'm gonna show you that I'm a frontrunner

[Suzuka] Who's gonna be a rival to me? [Falko] How far am I still from you?
[All] In truth my restlessness is killing me

[Maru] "All surpassing, all prevailing"  [Ines] It's just the way I roll
[Suzuka] Wanna be  [Ines] The only  [Bourbon]One to you
[All] A final plan to work my escape arts
An anytime Climax!!

Running away! (Running away!)
Breaking away! (Breaking away!)
[Suzuka] DARLING  I WANT YOU!!
[Maru] It's not an option  To stop when in love
[All] Gather my nerves and run that final straight

Running away! (Running away!)
Breaking away! (Breaking away!)
[Ines] BABY  I LOVE YOU
[All] I'm pressing forwards right now  Closer to you
I wanna be the first to tell you  You're my  Only Love

[Bourbon] Of everyone in the world
[Ines] You're the only one I want with me
[Falko] I don't wanna end up as friends~
[All] No way, I will  Turn that around

[Maru] Another second faster!
[Suzuka] 'Cause you're waiting for me
[All] As I run, and I run, and I run, I ran away  My great escape

Running away! [Running away!]
Breaking away! [Breaking away!]
DARLING  I WANT YOU!!
