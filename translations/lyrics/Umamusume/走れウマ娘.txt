"They turn the last corner and enter the straight,
All horsegirls start their spurt in unison!
It's anyone's guess who will come out on top!
Ho now, someone's coming up from the back at massive pace!
Special Week, it's Special Week!
Silence Suzuka's still in the lead!
Tamamo Cross is making her move!
Only one can claim victory in the Winter Dream Trophy!"

Here 'n now a great race is about to start (Hup, ho!)
A flurry of outfits sparkling in the sun (Hup, ho!)
Anticipation is oozing from the stands (Yoâ€” What's on?)
Today at the Derby, joy is in the air (Go get 'em!!)

Run 'n shine, run 'n shine, horsegirl of mine (Whoo-hoo!)
Dark ones or favorites, they can't block your line (Hoo, woo!)
Run 'n shine, run 'n shine, horsegirl of mine (Whoo-hoo!)
Catch 'em up 'n pass them, then leave them behin' (Heck yeah!!) 

Starting with a dash but doing so too late (Huh, what's wrong?)
Wherever she runs she's running off the pace (Huh, what's wrong?)
If here and now my girl were to really lose (Hup, ho!)
Then how will I cheer for her at the winning live!? (Go get 'em!!)

Run 'n shine, run 'n shine, run 'n shine, horsegirl of mine (Whoo-hoo!)
Dark ones or favorites, they can't block your line (Hoo, woo!)
Run 'n shine, run 'n shine, run 'n shine, horsegirl of mine (Whoo-hoo!)
Catch 'em up 'n pass them, then leave them behin' (Heck yeah!!) 

"Well, I've been thinking a lot about how to make the Twinkle series more exciting.
After careful consideration, I have arrived at the following conclusion.
Added to today's lunch menu will be Carrot Hamburger and yakisoba mains, sugar cube sides, with apples and bananas as desserts.
I would like to tell all trainers; thank you for your understanding, and ramen and gyoza are my favorite foods.
Snacks are available 24/7 all throughout the year but I also dearly wish to express my love of carrots."

"Now then, the Winter Dream Trophy everyone dreams of!
All horsegirls have entered their gates, and they're off!
Silence Suzuka leads the 17 others into the first corner!
Maruzensky's 4 lengths behind, followed by Daiwa Scarlet!
They've passed the 2nd and 3rd corners, with the 4th coming into view. Suzuka still leads!
And someone's picking up speed in the back!
Special Week, it's Special Week!
And Tamamo Cross follows her!
The end of this magnificent race draws near!"

Run 'n shine, run 'n shine, run 'n shine, horsegirl of mine (Whoo-hoo!)
Dark ones or favorites, they can't block your line (Hoo, woo!)
Run 'n shine, run 'n shine, run 'n shine, horsegirl of mine (Whoo-hoo!)
Catch 'em up 'n pass them, then leave them behin' (Heck yeah!!) 

And yet, is it a miracle or an act of god? (Whoo-hoo!)
She's finding herself in the leading group (Howwat!?)
Bursting out the front side before anyone knew (Heck yeah!)
Making her live show a joyous event! (Here we go!)

Run 'n shine, run 'n shine, horsegirl of mine (Whoo-hoo!)
