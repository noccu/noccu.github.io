(Wow wow wow wow）
(Wow wow wow wow）
Here we are together at last

Don't stop! No, don't stop 'til finish! (Wo oh oh)
Don't stop! No, don't stop 'til finish! (Wo oh oh)

Takataktak  Wanna run as hard as I can
In the grass, in the sand  Your pre-race training menu
Turn up! (Turn up!) Raise your voice, shout out loud (wo oh oh)
Tracen! Fight! (Ooh) Fight! (Ooh!)

Takataktak  Wanna beat my own time as hard as I can
On my way to my dream I won't yield (wow wow)
Start it right here  My own greatest story (Wow wow wow)
(O-oh-o-oh おっおっおー! O-oh-o-oh おっおっおー!)

To the place that I long for (Borrowing my courage just a bit)
Talking about a memory (The right now we won't see back again)
Oh  These bump-a-bumps and these thump-a-thumps
No I can't contain  I can't get enough
These strong tinglings just don't wanna stop

With you I  Run to the finish line striving all the way
In the distance I already hear the music
Forever forever forever forever in my thoughts  If my dream will be within reach soon
I'll believe in what I felt that day  The special thing you held in you
Crossing springtimes 'n summers 'n autumns 'n winters   Darting towards the wish I call my dream
To Victory

Don't stop! No, don't stop 'til finish! (Wo oh oh)
Don't stop! No, don't stop 'til finish! (Wo oh oh)

Takataktak  Wanna spurt as hard as I can
Meeting  Expecting  Deciding  They connect who I am
Hands up! (Hands up!) Shout as loud as you can (wo oh oh)
Tracen! Fight! (Ooh) Fight! (Ooh!)

Takataktak  Wanna laugh as hard as I can
Right in the middle of this turf (wow wow)
Start it for real  My own rising story(Wow wow wow)
(O-oh-o-oh おっおっおー! O-oh-o-oh おっおっおー!)

These days that I dashed through  (Today's better than yesterday)
Talking about my glory (The reason why I can become strong)
Now  I wanna say I'm  "Living at my top"
The cheers pushing me on  Heating up
This dream's my dream I won't let it end a fantasy

With you I  Build a future starting at the finish line
Aspiring pursuing seizing winning
Forever forever forever forever in my thoughts  My dream's only a few steps away
Believing in what you shed that day  The stream of tears which ran from you
Crossing rainstorms 'n galewinds 'n grey clouds 'n darkness  Darting towards the wish I call my dream
To Victory

Unshakable I hold my resolve to my chest
One by one our achievements are strung together
Shake off the doubts I have looming over me
All I have to do is overcome myself
Wanna win  Wanna win  Wanna win  I wanna win with you

Build a future starting at the finish line
Aspiring pursuing seizing winning
Forever forever forever forever in my thoughts  My dream's only a few steps away
Believing in what you shed that day  The stream of tears which ran from you
Crossing springtimes 'n summers 'n autumns 'n winters  
Crossing rainstorms 'n galewinds 'n grey clouds 'n darkness
Victory

With you I  Run to the finish line striving all the way
In the distance I already hear the music
Forever forever forever forever in my thoughts  If my dream will be within reach soon
I'll believe in what I felt that day  The special thing you held in you
Crossing springtimes 'n summers 'n autumns 'n winters   Darting towards the wish I call my dream
To Victory

Build a future starting at the finish line
Aspiring pursuing seizing winning
Forever forever forever forever in my thoughts  My dream's only a few steps away
Believing in what you shed that day  The stream of tears which ran from you

To Victory

Don't stop! No, don't stop 'til finish!
